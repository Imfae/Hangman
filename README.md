# Hangman
In this console-version of Hangman, player attempts to guess a computer-chosen word between 5 and 12 characters long. 

The player is given 7 lives. One life is deducted for each incorrect guess. The game ends when all 7 lives are deducted or when the player successfully guesses the word.

An in-game save feature is implemented so a player can load a previously-saved game or save a current game for later.
